# CONTINUITY — Wallet Policy COMPOSER cycle (arbitrary tr/wsh authoring on the SH2), 2026-09-01

**Resume here.** Usage ran low with R0 round 0 in flight; the operator ruled
"finish what is in flight but don't launch anything new" (2026-09-01).

## In flight when usage ran low — R0 ROUND 0, four opus lenses, dispatched 2026-09-01

Each agent writes its own report (the controller never transcribes):

| lens | report path |
| --- | --- |
| correctness + internal consistency | `design/agent-reports/composer-spec-R0-r0-correctness.md` |
| adversarial funds safety (counterexamples) | `design/agent-reports/composer-spec-R0-r0-adversarial.md` |
| operator journey walk (J1 two-path tr, J2 RCW, J3 no-payload template) | `design/agent-reports/composer-spec-R0-r0-journey.md` |
| coverage + traceability (rulings→spec, rules→acceptance, work items→sections) | `design/agent-reports/composer-spec-R0-r0-coverage.md` |

**On resume:** (1) for each report that exists: read the PERSISTED file (never the
JSONL task output), independently re-run every measurable claim, `git add` it in
its OWN persist commit (short message: what it is, counts, what was verified,
"nothing folded"). (2) Fold all four into the spec together; run the gates and put
their output in the fold commit message:

    scripts/spec-structure-check.sh design/SPEC_wallet_policy_composer.md
    scripts/plan-glyph-check.sh     design/SPEC_wallet_policy_composer.md
    CITE_FORK_ROOT=/scratch/code/shibboleth/seedhammer scripts/plan-cite-check.sh design/SPEC_wallet_policy_composer.md

(`scripts/spec-check.py` is the systemwide-payload spec's own gate; its
remaining failures do not apply.) (3) Re-review only what the fold changed
(non-trivial folds), sonnet for fold-verification, opus for a new lens; a clean
round closes the LENS, not the spec — enumerate remaining lenses before closing.
(4) Then `superpowers:writing-plans` for the plan; implementation UC OFF, one
implementer; Rust first (md-codec `compose` + vectors) before the Go builder.

## Rulings that shape everything (verbatim in the brainstorm §2)

C1 spend-path list; C2 archetypes as presets; C3 firmware vocabulary, Rust-first;
C4 template first; C5 one slot one path, reuse the master via hardened accounts;
C6 Build inside Wallet Policy (door becomes a choice in every state); C7 Multisig
Build deprecated by COMMENT only; C8 payload-first seating (pick list, "remaining"
keys); C9 teach the mk1 stub unconditionally; C10 engraved FORM is the operator's
choice (concrete text/QR/keyed md1, or template + mk1); C11 timelock UI respects
ranges; C12 seeds (words/ms1, unsealed payload or typed) are a key source; C13
Full/Watch-only, secret as words/SeedQR/ms1; C14 no Sealed-Payload memory
treatment; C15 lowering lives in md-codec `compose` / `md compose`; C16 grammar
bounds; C17 pkh in wsh, pk in tr (F-448); C18 raw-H NUMS this cycle (F-449); C19-
C23 review findings (first-appearance numbering, or_i(pkh) head, or_d for bare
multi head, keyless wsh-only, lock-only refused, ≥1 keyed path, first-listed
single key as internal key, lock ranges sourced); C24 pack time via `now:` record
= lower bound; C25 entry UX (digit pad; kind→unit→digits→echo; hash: record);
C26 Build with no payload = keyless template; C27 recon fan-out (3 deferred);
C28 taproot seed-derived origin `m/48'/coin'/account'/3'`; C29 same seed twice in
ONE path = warning.

## Lessons this session recorded (also in memory)

- Line counts are not a fold check: five rulings silently failed to land because
  an anchor differed by one character; grep the inserted row afterwards.
- A regtest node rejects mainnet xpubs: a "refusal" can be the network, not the
  descriptor. Match the agent's environment before calling its claim wrong.
- The compiler is a validity oracle, not a byte oracle; byte identity with the
  toolkit archetypes is impossible under any uniform rule.
