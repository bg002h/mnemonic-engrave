# CONTINUITY — S2 cycle, started 2026-08-29 morning

## Mandate

Operator, 2026-08-29 (verbatim): **"Do the prep /merge you suggest first and
flash it, but I have to leave. So after flash let's start s2"** — following
the same morning's rulings: fork main merged (F-425 resolved), debris branch
removed, F-420 shipped in descriptor-mnemonic.

## Standing state

- **SH2 flashed 2026-08-29** from fork `main` @ `a5e29b4` via `sh2-flash`
  (load + verify 100%; boot to be judged on MACHINE power — laptop port
  dark-screen+BOOTSEL is the PD-contract check, not a signature reject).
  That flash was operator-authorized. **No further flash is autonomous.**
- S1+S3 shipped (engrave `f244442`); descriptor-mnemonic at `6c4a56fd`
  (F-420); fork `main` = `a5e29b4`.

## S2 cycle plan

`design/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_descriptor_input_S2.md` @ `027629c` (cite gate
26/26). Recon: `design/agent-reports/RECON-S2-fork-seam.md` (`4646fa2`).
R0 loop in flight (opus round 1, report lands at
`design/agent-reports/R0-S2-plan-r1.md`). Scale: 5 expected-good / fable at
15 / hard stop 25. Persist-before-fold; agent-persisted reports; whole-repo
propagation sweeps + generators; both clippy toolchains (F-430).

## Boundaries

No tags, no releases, no publishes. **Operator-gated tail (P5.4): every
flash, §11 item 6 (ClassDescriptor DISPLAYED on the device), F-423's
physical test plate + cut.** F-422 status quo stands — no transform.
Fork `main` push only after the post-impl review closes green (the device
boots main).

## Resume protocol

After a context clear: `/resume-s2` (command saved at
`~/.claude/commands/resume-s2.md`). It points here, names the first action
(persist any uncommitted R0 report), and restates the boundaries.
